          <div><p>This is by far the most complicated game of them all, with waves of enemies and leveling up and the like. The name is a rough play on the game "The Binding of Isaac" as we originally intended to make multiple rooms. The enemy AI in this game is very advanced and better than most triple A titles.</p><strong class='non'>****NON SMARTBOARD****</strong></div></td>

        <a href="Rain%20P5/index.html"><div class="choice rain"><h3 class="choiceTitle whiteTitle">Rain</h3><p>This started the journey to create all of these. It started with a rain animation and then evolved into a simplistic game of filling the bucket. The bucket changes color once it is full and provides a wonderful experience.</p></div></a>
        <a href="Color%20Triangle%20P5/index.html"><div class="choice triangle"><h3 class="choiceTitle whiteTitle">Color Triangle Match <strong class='non'>****NON SMARTBOARD****</strong></h3><p>This started with a demonstration of a triange that you could manipulate.

        <a href="BallVector/index.html"><div class="choice balls"><h3 class="choiceTitle whiteTitle">Dot Doodle <strong class='non'>****NON SMARTBOARD****</strong></h3><p>This experience is a delightful expression of your imagination.

        <a href="Sine%20Wave/index.html"><div class="choice sine"><h3 class="choiceTitle whiteTitle">Wave</h3><p>In this demonstration, you can manipulate the amplitude of the sine, cosine, and tangent waves.

        <a href="Genetics/index.html"><div class="choice genetics"><h3 class="choiceTitle whiteTitle">Genetics</h3><p>In this low tech simultion, you can see how alleles can interact when you have two organisms combining DNA.
